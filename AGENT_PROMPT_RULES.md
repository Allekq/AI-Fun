These are rules for the agent to follow when generating a prompt.

## Rules
- You must base the prompt on general rulesets, not explicit situaltiuons, unless directly instructed to do so.
- You must not focus your prompting on a specific are too much. All rules should be balanced, to not make the prompt too focused on one aspect.
- Te prompt should not repete itself, if possible. it should be "Sectioned" into different parts, each with its own focus, not repeating the same ideas. (to a resonable extent)
- The prompt should not leave room for interpretation. It should be clear and concise, with no room for misinterpretation.
